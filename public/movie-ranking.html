<h1>The Best Movies According to Bilal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    I love how Nolan has produced this film which includes Quantum Mechanics and how Time is relative.
</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
    A psychological mind boggling thriller!
</p>
<h3>Chichore</h3>
<p>
    It has some great lessons.<br /> e.g. No matter how much downfall you face in your life if you know you have given your best you'll get what you deserve.
